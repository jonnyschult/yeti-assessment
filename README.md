# Yeti page clone

This project recreates a design spec from Zeplin and assigned by Yeti using React Typescript and MUI v5.

## Start App

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Notes

I tried to find a balance between three competing desiderata. First, I wanted to replicate as close to the spec as possible. Second, I wanted the page to display right going through the breakpoints while only designing the two views I was given. And third, I wanted to use MUI's most recent version, which was new to me, so as to implement a realistic engineering process which would plausible be extensible. I privileged the second and third desires over the former, but I think I stuck pretty close to the original design.

I started this project on Monday afternoon. Picked it up again on Tuesday afternoon and finished Tuesday evening.
