# Yeti page clone

This project recreates a design spec from Zeplin and assigned by Yeti using React Typescript and MUI v5.

## Start App

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Notes

I tried to find a balance between three competing desiderata. First, I wanted to replicate as close to the spec as possible. Second, I wanted the page to display right going through the breakpoints while only designing the two views I was given. And third, I wanted to use MUI's most recent version, which was new to me, so as to implement a realistic engineering process which would plausible be extensible. I privileged the second and third desires over the first, but I think I stuck pretty close to the original design.\
\
If I could talk to the designers, I might point out that the images are skewing in the larger view, which can lead to some unfortunate stretching when the browser window is resized. It might be better practice to cover with the image and fill in with text or something else on a larger screen.\

I started this project on Monday afternoon. Picked it up again on Tuesday afternoon and finished Tuesday evening.
